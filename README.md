# Welcome Docker Users! üöÄ

**Reactfolio** now supports Docker from version 1.4.0! If you're interested in containerizing your portfolio and deploying it with ease, you're in the right place. We've created a new `docker-deploy` branch specifically for users who want to build and deploy their projects using Docker. This branch includes automated deployment via GitHub Actions, making it simpler than ever to showcase your work.

# Installation & Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps to create and deploy your portfolio:

## Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository üìÇ

To begin, you should fork this repository so you have your own copy of the project.

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of this page to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. Once the repository is forked, clone it to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saqibbedar/Reactfolio.git
```

## Step 2: Update [`assets.js`](https://github.com/saqibbedar/Reactfolio/blob/main/src/assets/assets.js) file Data üìù

The main data for the portfolio is located in the `assets.js` file. Open it and replace the dummy data with your actual information:

Here is a basic structure of what you need to update in assets.js`

```js
// Replace dummy values with your actual information.
const AboutPage = {
  authorProfile: "Your Profile Image URL",
  authorDescription: "A short bio about yourself",
  getInTouchUrl: "Your Contact Page URL",
  authorName: "Your Name",
  profileImgTagLine: "Your Job Title or Tagline",
  authorContactMail: "Your Email Address",
  authorContactNumber: "Your Phone Number",
};

// Similarly, update other values as needed...
```

## Step 3: Docker Setup üê≥

If you prefer Docker for serving your portfolio, follow these steps:

- **Build Docker Image**

  1. Build the Docker image by navigating to your project directory and running:

      ```bash
      docker build -t reactfolio .
      ```
  2. Once the image is built, you can run it with:
      ```bash
      docker run -d -p 5000:5000 reactfolio
      ```
      The portfolio will be served locally at http://localhost:5000.

## Step 4: Switch to `docker-deploy` Branch

Before making any changes, ensure you are on the `docker-deploy` branch. You can switch to this branch using the following command:

```bash
git checkout docker-deploy
```

## Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub

Once you‚Äôve updated the `assets.js` file, you can push your changes to your GitHub repository on the `docker-deploy` branch.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Customize portfolio"
git push origin docker-deploy
```
